Scripts contains backend scripts that cant interfere with the frontend like database seeding, cronjobs and migrations.

Why Keep scripts/ at the Root?
Itâ€™s not part of Next.js's compiled code, so keeping it separate prevents it from interfering with frontend builds.
Developers can easily run database scripts or any scripts from the root with:

```
node scripts/seed.js
```

Similar to other backend scripts (like migrations or cron jobs), it's more organized.
